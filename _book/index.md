# Preface

## Introduction

The bookdown project "Learning Data Science with R" will function as my personal notebook for learning data science with R. 

Judging my knowledge state personally, I believe I am currently (December 2021) on an intermediate level in R. This in-between status of my working knowledge (not a beginner and not an expert) is precisely the reason why I started this notebook. It is difficult to advance on this intermediate level as a self-determined learner. 

Reading newly published books on data science is not as effective as I would wish. Much of the material I already know, so I have to look for the hidden gems of knowledge that are new for me. But more importantly, some of the books do not incorporate the modern trend I am interested in: Using the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` approach for data wrangling, data analysis, and data modeling.

Furthermore is my statistical knowledge poor. The historical reason is my distrust of the NHST (Null Hypothesis Significance Test) at a time I didn't even know of this notion and other related issues like p-hacking. Therefore I am also interested to learn more about the differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches. 

Up to now, I have written personal notes and ran code examples by accompanying specific books. But in the last weeks, it turned out that this approach is not very practical. I am exposed to new material from many different sources (books, blogs, vignettes of packages, etc.), where I want to jot down my reflections and experiment with the code snippets. Therefore I thought that a general (meta) notebook would help me advance more effectively.
